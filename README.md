# Triangles-ruby
A Ruby App that determines the type of Triangle

## Introduction
A Triangle class includes methods for initializing new triangles and determining the triangle type. Keep in mind that not all combinations of three numbers make valid triangles. For example, (2, 2, 8) does not make a triangle.

# Methodology
The Web page lets the user input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and tells whether they form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle
